            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 16, 2025</p>

            <div class="legal-summary">
                <h3>Privacy at a Glance</h3>
                <p><strong>Your privacy is our priority.</strong> Vylo is designed with a privacy-first approach. We do not collect, store, or share your personal information. All your data stays on your device. You don't need to create an account, and we don't track your affirmation usage.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Vylo ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with our mobile application Vylo (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.</p>
            <p>By using Vylo, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
            <p>Vylo is built on a <strong>local-first architecture</strong>, which means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.</li>
                <li><strong>No Account Required:</strong> You don't need to create an account or log in to use Vylo.</li>
                <li><strong>No Affirmation Tracking:</strong> We do not track which affirmations you view, favorite, or interact with.</li>
                <li><strong>No User-Generated Content:</strong> Any personalization data you provide (such as your name during onboarding) is stored exclusively on your device and never transmitted to our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>No Location Data:</strong> We do not collect or access your location information.</li>
                <li><strong>No Contact Information:</strong> We do not access your contacts, calendar, or other personal device data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Information Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
            <p>To provide personalized features, Vylo stores certain information directly on your device using iOS's local storage mechanisms (UserDefaults and App Groups). This data <strong>never leaves your device</strong> and includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Onboarding Preferences:</strong> Your name (if provided), selected categories, notification preferences, theme choices, and app icon preference.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Your daily streak count, favorite affirmations, affirmation history, and onboarding completion status.</li>
                <li><strong>App Settings:</strong> Language preference, notification schedule, selected categories, and theme customization.</li>
                <li><strong>Widget Data:</strong> Affirmations displayed in your Home Screen and Lock Screen widgets are stored in a shared App Group container accessible only by Vylo and its widgets.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can delete all locally stored data by uninstalling the App from your device.</p>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>While we don't collect your data, we use third-party services to provide essential functionality. These services may collect limited information as described below:</p>

            <h3>4.1 RevenueCat (Subscription Management)</h3>
            <p>We use RevenueCat to manage in-app subscriptions and purchases. RevenueCat may collect:</p>

                <li>Anonymous user identifiers (generated by RevenueCat, not linked to your identity)</li>
                <li>Purchase transaction information (subscription status, purchase dates)</li>
                <li>Device information (iOS version, device type)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>RevenueCat's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy</a></p>

            <h3>4.2 Mixpanel (Analytics)</h3>
            <p>We use Mixpanel to understand how users interact with the App and improve the user experience. Mixpanel may collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anonymous usage analytics (screens viewed, features used)</li>
                <li>Device information (iOS version, device model, screen size)</li>
                <li>App performance metrics (crashes, load times)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Mixpanel does <strong>not</strong> receive any personally identifiable information from us. You can opt out of analytics tracking in the App settings.</p>
            <p>Mixpanel's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/</a></p>

            <h3>4.3 TikTok SDK (Attribution)</h3>
            <p>We use the TikTok SDK for attribution purposes to understand which marketing campaigns are effective. The TikTok SDK may collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Device identifiers (IDFA/IDFV, if you've granted permission)</li>
                <li>App installation and first-launch events</li>
                <li>Device information (iOS version, device model)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can limit ad tracking through your iOS device settings (Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking).</p>
            <p>TikTok's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy</a></p>

            <h3>4.4 Apple (Notifications & Widgets)</h3>
            <p>When you enable notifications, we use Apple's Push Notification Service (APNs) to schedule local notifications on your device. These notifications are <strong>generated and delivered locally</strong> on your device—we do not send push notifications from a server.</p>
            <p>Widgets use iOS's WidgetKit framework and access affirmation data stored in a shared App Group container on your device.</p>

            <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Vylo is intended for users aged 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 (or under 16 in the European Economic Area). If we learn that we have inadvertently collected information from a child, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

            <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
            <p>Since all your personal data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on your device's security measures. We recommend:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using a strong passcode or biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID) on your device</li>
                <li>Keeping your iOS software up to date</li>
                <li>Only downloading Vylo from the official Apple App Store</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For data transmitted to third-party services (subscriptions, analytics), we rely on industry-standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS).</p>

            <h2>7. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
            <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your information:</p>

                <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You can opt out of analytics tracking in the App settings.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Since your data is stored locally on your device, there are no international transfers of your personal data.
