            <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the App (or any part thereof) at any time, with or without notice, for any reason. We will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the App.</p>

            <h3>13.2 Terms Changes</h3>

            <h3>14.1 Termination by You</h3>

            <h2>15. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <h3>15.1 Governing Law</h3>
            <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>

            <h3>15.2 Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>Any disputes arising out of or related to these Terms or the App shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, except as otherwise provided below.</p>

            <h3>15.3 Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>
            <p>You may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. Additionally, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in court to prevent infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights.</p>

            <h3>15.4 Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p>You agree to resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and waive your right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.</p>

            <h3>15.5 Jurisdiction</h3>
            <p>For any disputes not subject to arbitration, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California.</p>

            <h2>16. Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The invalid provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable.</p>

            <h2>17. Entire Agreement</h2>
            <p>These Terms, together with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, constitute the entire agreement between you and Vylo regarding your use of the App and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, and representations.</p>

            <h2>18. Waiver</h2>
            <p>Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other provision. No waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Vylo.</p>

            <h2>19. Assignment</h2>
            <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms without restriction. Any attempted assignment in violation of this section is void.</p>

            <h2>21. Apple-Specific Terms</h2>
